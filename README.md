# Pursuit-Evasion-with-AUV
This repository contains the simulations of a pursuit-evasion game with AUV as the agents. 

Pursuit evasion games are a class of two-player zero-sum differential games that model and analyze conflict situations that evolve over time. It is a useful tool to give qualitative insights into military situations by understanding the interaction between two agents that represent the original systems engaged in conflict. However, most of the current literature considers relatively simplistic dynamics with a majority considering holonomic agents. Thus, an attempt is made to address this issue by taking an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as the agent.
